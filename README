JustBOOT(tm) a gentoo livecd generator is in early beta, below are some of the
commands that you should run to help me focus on code and bug fixing. Any
suggestions, comments or criticism is appreciated as long
as it's constructive. I hope you enjoy the script and ideas are welcome.

This script uses a standard autotools based build system, so to install it into
/usr/local, do the following:

autoreconf -i
./configure
make
make install

The autoreconf step is only needed if you are building this script directly
from the git repository. The make install step should be run as root.

*** NOTE that only zen-sources is supported with --kernel flag for now ***

Start by running all or some of the following commands:

justboot --arch=x86_64 --root-passwd="gentoo rocks"
justboot --arch=i686 --volid=gentoo
justboot --arch=x86_64 -ramfs # MAKE SURE YOU HAVE >4GB of RAM
justboot --arch=x86_64 --purge
justboot --arch=x86_64 --root-passwd="gentoo rocks" --volid=gentoo --data-directory=/opt
justboot --arch=x86_64 --make-opts=-j3 --niceness=-5
justboot --arch=i686 --package-manager=pkgcore

File locations for extra packages, excluded directories and ramfs mounts are
located at /etc/justboot/files

Per user configuration options for gentoo make.conf can be set in
~/.justboot/arch.conf where arch is either i386,i486,i586,i686 or x86_64

Thanks for your testing
